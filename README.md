## Note: had very limited time to make test pixel perfect, sorry about that :) Initialy i was planing to make it properly, redux and etc but realised
## i don't have enough time for that. Some of workflow/naming i wasn't sure , so left incomplete, if you ask me i can add aditional functionality  ASAP.
## Also still need to improve on validation , make code more bullet proof as at the momment can blow up in certain conditions.
## Thank You !
